# Tutorial - Using Shiny & Leaflet to Explore Spatial Datasets

By: [Simon Goring](http://github.com/SimonGoring)
Date: March 7, 2016

A tutorial to test out some ideas for a Shiny/Leaflet interaction.  This tutorial will be presented as part of the UBC Mozilla [R Study Group] (https://github.com/minisciencegirl/studyGroup).

The intent is to help you get started using both [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) together in R to do basic data exploration with geospatial data.  The tutorial assumes you have some experience in R, but takes a "plug & play" approach - copy the code as is, and then play around with it.  Even a beginner should be able to get this code to work.

In this tutorial you will:

1. Learn briefly about leaflet & shiny
2. Install the leaflet and Shiny packages
3. Produce a very basic leaflet map and learn some elementary functions
4. Download a file from GitHub
5. Build a simply Shiny app with a slider bar and drop down menu
6. Explore a dataset.

I've tried to structure the main document to be a 'chatty' tutorial, so you can walk through things on your own, but ultimately we only get so far in developing the tutorial because the workshop session is only one hour long.
